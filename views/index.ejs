						<h2>Tylor Swifit</h2>
						<p>Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Her narrative songwriting, which often takes inspiration from her personal life, has received widespread critical plaudits and media coverage.

							Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift relocated to Nashville, Tennessee in 2004 to pursue a career in country music. She broke into the country scene with the release of her eponymous debut studio album in 2006, buoyed by the singles "Teardrops on My Guitar" and "Our Song". Swift rose to mainstream prominence with her second studio album, Fearless (2008), a country pop record with crossover appeal. Aided by the top-ten singles "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me", Fearless was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Swift's third studio album, Speak Now (2010), blended her country pop style with elements of rock. It yielded the singles "Mine", "Back to December", and "Mean", all of which proved successful on country and pop charts.
							
							Drawing inspiration from various pop, rock, and electronic genres, Swift's fourth studio album Red (2012) saw her transcending her country roots. With her fifth studio album, the synth pop-focused 1989 (2014), Swift officially shifted to pop. She broadened the electropop sound on her next two studio albums, Reputation (2017) and Lover (2019), which embraced urban and retro styles, respectively. The albums spawned a string of international top-five singles, including "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together", "I Knew You Were Trouble", "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", "Bad Blood", "Look What You Made Me Do", and "Me!". Swift experimented with folk and alternative rock on her eighth and ninth studio albums, Folklore and Evermore (both released in 2020), whose respective lead singles, "Cardigan" and "Willow", reached top-tier chart positions.
							
							With sales of over 200 million records worldwide, Swift is one of the world's best-selling music artists. Her accolades include 10 Grammy Awards (including two Album of the Year wins), an Emmy Award, seven Guinness World Records, 32 American Music Awards (the most wins by an artist), and 23 Billboard Music Awards (the most wins by a woman). She ranked eighth on Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists Chart and, as a songwriter, was recognized in Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time (2015). Swift has been included in various power rankings, such as Time's annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world (2010, 2015 and 2019) and Forbes Celebrity 100 (placing first in 2016 and 2019). She was named Woman of the Decade (2010s) by Billboard and Artist of the Decade (2010s) by the American Music Awards..</p>

						<h3>I come back stronger than a 90â€™s trend</h3>
						<p>Lyrics
							I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
							Rough on the surface but you cut through like a knife
							And if it was an open-shut case
							I never would've known from that look on your face
							Lost in your current like a priceless wine
							The more that you say
							The less I know
							Wherever you stray
							I follow
							I'm begging for you to take my hand
							Wreck my plans
							That's my man
							Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh)
							Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneaking in
							As if you were a mythical thing
							Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
							And there was one prize I'd cheat to win
							The more that you say
							The less I know
							Wherever you stray
							I follow
							I'm begging for you to take my hand
							Wreck my plans
							That's my man
							You know that my train could take you home
							Anywhere else is hollow
							I'm begging for you to take my hand
							Wreck my plans
							That's my man
							Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh)
							They count me out time and time again
							Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh)
							But I come back stronger than a 90's trend
							Wait for the signal and I'll meet you after dark
							Show me the places where the others gave you scars
							Now this is an open-shut case
							Guess I should've known from the look on your face
							Every bait and switch was a work of art
							The more that you say
							The less I know
							Wherever you stray
							I follow
							I'm begging for you to take my hand
							Wreck my plans
							That's my man
							You know that my train could take you home
							Anywhere else is hollow
							I'm begging for you to take my hand
							Wreck my plans
							That's my man
							The more that you say
							The less I know
							Wherever you stray
							I follow
							Begging for you to take my hand
							Wreck my plans
							That's my man
							You know that my train could take you home
							Anywhere else is hollow
							Begging for you to take my hand
							Wreck my plans
							That's my man
							Hey, that's my man
							That's my man
							Yeah, that's my man
							Every bait and switch was a work of art
							That's my man
							Hey, that's my man
							I'm begging for you to take my hand
							Wreck my plans
							That's my man.</p>
