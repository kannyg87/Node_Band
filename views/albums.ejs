							<h3>I come back stronger than a 90â€™s trend</h3>
							<p>Lyrics
								I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
								Rough on the surface but you cut through like a knife
								And if it was an open-shut case
								I never would've known from that look on your face
								Lost in your current like a priceless wine
								The more that you say
								The less I know
								Wherever you stray
								I follow
								I'm begging for you to take my hand
								Wreck my plans
								That's my man
								Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh)
								Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneaking in
								As if you were a mythical thing
								Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
								And there was one prize I'd cheat to win
								The more that you say
								The less I know
								Wherever you stray
								I follow
								I'm begging for you to take my hand
								Wreck my plans
								That's my man
								You know that my train could take you home
								Anywhere else is hollow
								I'm begging for you to take my hand
								Wreck my plans
								That's my man
								Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh)
								They count me out time and time again
								Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh)
								But I come back stronger than a 90's trend
								Wait for the signal and I'll meet you after dark
								Show me the places where the others gave you scars
								Now this is an open-shut case
								Guess I should've known from the look on your face
								Every bait and switch was a work of art
								The more that you say
								The less I know
								Wherever you stray
								I follow
								I'm begging for you to take my hand
								Wreck my plans
								That's my man
								You know that my train could take you home
								Anywhere else is hollow
								I'm begging for you to take my hand
								Wreck my plans
								That's my man
								The more that you say
								The less I know
								Wherever you stray
								I follow
								Begging for you to take my hand
								Wreck my plans
								That's my man
								You know that my train could take you home
								Anywhere else is hollow
								Begging for you to take my hand
								Wreck my plans
								That's my man
								Hey, that's my man
								That's my man
								Yeah, that's my man
								Every bait and switch was a work of art
								That's my man
								Hey, that's my man
								I'm begging for you to take my hand
								Wreck my plans
								That's my man.</p>
